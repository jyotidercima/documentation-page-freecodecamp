<h2>Documentation page for the topic - Machine Learning With AI<h2></h2>
In this project under freecodecamp Responsive Web Design - I have created fixed left navigation and made a documentation page on machine learning and artificial intelligence 
also have added media queries to change side navigation to top in mobile view.
