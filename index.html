      <ul>
        <li>
          <header>Supervised Learning:</header>
          <p>This type of machine learning involves training algorithms using labeled data, where the
            desired output is known. It is highly accurate and uses a feedback mechanism to improve predictions.
            Examples
            include linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines (SVMs).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <header>Unsupervised Learning:</header>
          <p>In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data to discover
            underlying patterns or groupings. It is less accurate compared to supervised learning and does not use
            labeled
            data or a feedback mechanism.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <header>Semi-Supervised Learning:</header>
          <p>This approach combines supervised and unsupervised learning, using both labeled and
            unlabeled data for training. It is particularly useful when labeled data is scarce but there is a large
            amount
            of unlabeled data available.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <header>Reinforcement Learning:</header>
          <p>This type of learning involves a reward-punishment system where an algorithm learns to
            perform a series of actions to achieve a goal in an interactive environment. It does not require labeled
            data
            and is often used in applications like self-driving cars and gaming.</p>

        <li>
          <header>Code Engineering:</header>
          <p>Integrating the ML model into the final product, which involves model serving and
            performance monitoring.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each phase is crucial for ensuring that the final model is accurate, reliable, and delivers value to the
        organization.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the workflow may involve hyperparameter tuning, a critical phase where the best settings for the
        model's hyperparameters are chosen to optimize performance.</p>
      <p>Understanding and following a structured ML workflow helps improve efficiency, maintain model integrity, and
        make informed decisions throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
